# SwiftUIcon

**SwiftUIIcon** is a set of scripts and helpers for creating your iOS or iPadOS app icon in SwiftUI using shape and path drawing primitives.

## Getting Started

Adding this to your project is currently a manual process and requires 3 steps:

1. Download and expand the [latest release zip](https://github.com/velos/SwiftUIcon/releases/latest) and drag the `Icon` folder into the root of your project, copying the files into the project, creating a group and adding the files to your App target.
1. Un-include the `generate.swift` and `IconGenerator.swift` files from your App's target since those are only going to be run from the Run Script build phase and won't compile as part of your app.
1. Add a Run Script build phase before your Copy Resources phase and specify the path to `Icon.swift` as the first Input File (probably `$(PROJECT_DIR)/$(PRODUCT_NAME)/Icon/Icon.swift`):

```bash
[[ "$ENABLE_PREVIEWS" = "NO" ]] || exit 0
[[ "$MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MAJOR" -ge "101500" ]] || exit 0

TMPFILE=`mktemp /tmp/SwiftUIcon.swift.XXXXXX` || exit 1
trap "rm -f $TMPFILE" EXIT

if [ -z "$SCRIPT_INPUT_FILE_0" ]
then
    echo "error: You must specify your Icon.swift as the first Input File in the Build Phase."
    exit 1
fi

if [ ! -f "$SCRIPT_INPUT_FILE_0" ]
then
    echo "File $SCRIPT_INPUT_FILE_0 not found."
    exit 1
fi

cat ${SCRIPT_INPUT_FILE_0%/*}/*.swift > $TMPFILE

xcrun -sdk macosx swift $TMPFILE
```

## Adding Your Icon

You can now edit the contents of the `IconStack` wrapper helper view inside of `Icon.swift`. This is essentially a `ZStack` with a `.center` alignment that provides a proxy to relatively position elements based on an assumed 1024x1024 canvas size. See [Apple's SwiftUI Drawing Tutorial](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/drawing-paths-and-shapes) for more info on drawing using SwiftUI.

## Limitations

* It's a bit of a hack, but [Velos](https://velosmobile.com/) is currently using it in a project üëç
* Installing this is pretty manual. Some currently technical issues prevent making it a Swift Package, but feel free to file an issue if you find a better way!
* Because the View is rendered at all the individual sizes, anything that has a fixed size will not scale properly. To get around this, you should use the `CanvasProxy` passed into the function builder of `IconStack`. Any place where you would normally have a hard-coded `value`, you should use `canvas[value]`. You can also scale fonts and other elements manually with the `CanvasProxy.scale` property. As an example, `Text("Testing").font(Font.system(size: 200 * canvas.scale))` should get you a properly scaled `Text` element.
* Since the run script essentially concatenates all the Swift files and runs it as a macOS script, any elements you use in your Icon must look the same on both iOS and macOS. So you should probably stay away from actual UI controls üòâ
